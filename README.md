# Boston-House-Price-Prediction-in-R

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
House sales are determined based on the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller home price indices and the housing price index of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). These reflect the trends of the US housing market. In addition to these housing price indices, the development of a housing price prediction (Linear Regression) model can greatly assist in the prediction of future housing prices.
