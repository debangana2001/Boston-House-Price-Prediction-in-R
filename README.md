# Boston-House-Price-Prediction-in-R

PROBLEM STATEMENT:
House sales are determined based on the Standard & Poor’s Case-Shiller home price indices and the housing price index of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO). These reflect the trends of the US housing market. In addition to these housing price indices, the development of a housing price prediction (Linear Regression) model can greatly assist in the prediction of future housing prices.
Essentially, our object is —
•	To identify the variables affecting house prices, e.g. per capita crime rate by the town, Average number of rooms, Tax value property-tax rate per $10,000 etc.
BUSSINESS GOAL:
We are required to model the price of houses with the available independent variables. It be used by the management to understand how exactly the prices vary with the independent variables. They can accordingly manipulate the design of the business strategy etc. to meet certain price levels. Further, the model will be a good way for management to understand the pricing dynamics of a new market.
